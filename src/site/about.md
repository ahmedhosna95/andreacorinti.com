## Resume

Looking for my [**professional resume** in PDF](https://andreacorinti.github.io/cv-eng.pdf) ?

<del>If you want, there's a **HTML** version too!</del>

And, even if I don't like the site very much, I'm also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-corinti/).

## Facebook

I've a profile but I use it only for managing pages, connected account and stuff like that, so I think that its pointless to link it here.
