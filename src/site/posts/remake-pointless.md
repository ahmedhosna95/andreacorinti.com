Let's say that you wanna play _The Secret of Monkey Island I_ and _II_.

Maybe for the first time (by all means do yourself a favour and play it!), or maybe just for ol' time's sake.

Well, you've got two option:

## The Special Edition from 2009

or

## The Original

(with all the old graphics array's modes)

## Fun fact: the remake is OLD!

Yep, it's been already ten years!

Soon remake and original will be closer to each other than to our current time.

## Remake â‰  Remastered

Generally speaking, **remastered tend to be a good thing** for all the parties included:

- **To the devs**: realize a "polished" version of a game usually cost a lot less than start blank with an all new project (and with the fielity issue)
- **To gamers**: you don't have to worry about **compatibility issues**, or find an old still-working console
- **First timers**: wonderful games like _Xenogears_ never got officialy released in Europe (can you belive it? Come on Square Enix do something!), _Final Fantasy Tactics_ come the first time with the PSP porting

(wip)
