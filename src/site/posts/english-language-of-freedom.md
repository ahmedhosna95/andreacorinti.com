Yep, my English it's not so great _awright_.

But I must improve and, if you're a fella non-native speaker, so should you.

Not only for school, work, travel, or hear the original voices in your favorite Netflix series.

But because english is **the language of freedom**.

## Don't give me the "America f*ck yeah!" thing please..

Easy you, my friend. [^friend]

[^friend]: Do you ever notice how many people from the east use A LOT the "my friend" sentece? Nothing against it mind you, but I find it a little creepy. Maybe it's because I'm italian (_"amico mio..."_ in italian urban dictionary sounds like a _threat_ !)


## So, my English sucks

Or at least that's what I _feel_.

I mean, it's not like that I can't write some tweets or small sentences...Hell, I can even make a decent amount of pages writing in English and, if I'm not too bored, do a nice grammar revision to correct the eventual mistakes.
